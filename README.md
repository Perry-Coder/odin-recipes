In this project, you are going to build a basic recipe website.
The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. 

But itâ€™s important to keep in mind that this project is just to build your HTML chops; 

Skill I will have to demonstrate:
    - Problem solving
    - Proper question asking
    - Knowing what and how to research something
    - Persistence
    - Knowing when to commit
